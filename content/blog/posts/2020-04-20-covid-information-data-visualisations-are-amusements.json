  "body": "Historically, humans have endured several epidemics and pandemics. What makes the CoVID 19 epidemic different is, it's co-existence with the information age. The age where we live between the concepts of technocracy and technopoly as explained by Neil Postman in his book Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. I bring this here as this idea sparked from the conversations one catches daily, and the observed unusuality of it in recent times. In this post, I first describe the unusualities observed and then apply Hiedeggarian view points by arguing that except raw data, every data visualation is an amusement. I wish to observe the epistemological structures of people during the pandemic information and probably connect with theories of anxiety and panic.\n\nPoints:\n0. Conversations changed-- how do people talk data ? A semi digital ethnographic study. \n1. there has been a exchanges of static and real-time data visualisations. \n2. Marshall McLuhan defines Media as 'anything that extends human senses'.",
